Hi, I'm a professional web developer and a graphic designer. I enjoy working with
Next.js and React for crafting beautiful front-end experiences and top notch design.

Previously, I'm working with only html but after sometime i started working with many frameworks including next.js react.js flask django and many more and now I'm expert in next.js web designing and reactjs static site generation.

  <Collapse title="How you started programming">
    <Text>
      Um, I stated learning HTML when i was in 7th I think 8th class. Our
      teacher teaches us about html to write code on notebook and then done a
      practical on computer in out computer lab. and although i also have
      interest in computer then i saw that all of the students are performing
      better than me. Then i started learning html on my full potencial then
      after 2 months I learned so much concepts of Html like meta descriptions,
      page arrangements, external hyperlinks and many more that's how i put my
      feet in programming. and at the end of the 8th class I started learning
      various programming languages and now I skilled to build static websites
      and many more. I like my work and game ;-)
