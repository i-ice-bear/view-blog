# Enterprise website project.
Some of the project that i worked for it and in this i work for an enterprise to build a static website in React framework for that enterprise. and here is it.

It's not a complete website it's just a static prototype. Because, it's confidencial and they don't want to upload all of the code on github that's why i just uploaded only prototype.
